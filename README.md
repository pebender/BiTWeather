# BiTWeather.jl

BiTWeather.jl is a collection of functions that I have been writing to help with our backyard garden. It reads weather data stored in a SQL database and performs calculations we find helpful in planting and maintaining our garden. I implement the functions as we need them for our garden.

For further information, check the [BiTWeather.jl documentation](https://pebender.github.io/BiTWeather/).
